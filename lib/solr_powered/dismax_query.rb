    # When a term from the users input is tested against multiple fields, more 
    # than one field may match and each field will generate a different score 
    # based on how common that word is in that field (for each document 
    # relative to all other documents). The "tie" param let's you configure 
    # how much the final score of the query will be influenced by the scores 
    # of the lower scoring fields compared to the highest scoring field.
    #
    # A value of "0.0" makes the query a pure "disjunction max query" -- only 
    # the maximum scoring sub query contributes to the final score. A value of 
    # "1.0" makes the query a pure "disjunction sum query" where it doesn't 
    # matter what the maximum scoring sub query is, the final score is the sum 
    # of the sub scores. Typically a low value (ie: 0.1) is useful.

    # clauses will be added directly to the main query. Otherwise, the query

    # Specifying functions with the "bf" param is just shorthand for using the 
    # _val_:"...function..." syntax in a "bq" param.
